# About Me

Hey there! I'm Vinayak, also known as Plakton, a passionate programmer with a love for gaming, sketching, and exploring the great outdoors on my bike. I enjoy creating innovative software solutions and tackling exciting projects. When I'm not coding or gaming, you can find me capturing the world through my sketches or going out on my bike to discover new trails.

- **Coding Projects**: I specialize in Java and Python, focusing on projects that intersect with my hobbies, like creative apps, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
- **Gaming Enthusiast**: I love diving into the latest games to get away from reality. I've also participated in various college tournaments, sharpening my skills and having fun.
- **Sketching**: Art is my escape. I often share my sketches inspired by my rides and favorite games.
